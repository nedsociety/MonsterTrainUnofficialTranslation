## Summary

If you decide to start a language project, the first thing you must do is to form a good team, and to decide your license.

## A good team

As of Monster Train build #12838, there are **7,510 strings** with **63,332 words** to translate[^*]. This is not an easy amount so you might want to form a good team to translate. Consult to your local community.

[^*]: Well, if you exclude unused strings then about 5% of them are gone, but it's hard to determine whether it is unused or not.

If you want, you can also translate entire game by yourself. This was the case for Korean translation, and it took almost two months for me to finish it on my spare time.

## Set your license for the translation

This is not a light topic, particularly because the project basically houses *fan translations*. Your translation will be a derivative work of the original game, and thus the original creators of the game, Shiny Shoe LLC, may exercise some rights on it if they think it's necessary. That does NOT mean they can take ownership of your translation, but they're highly likely to deny your translation to be used for profit.

This repository (and the corresponding plugin) won't accept a translation with a non-usable license. If you have no idea, choose something from a popular licenses, like [CC-BY-SA 2.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/) or [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).

Finally, be sure to make your team comply to your CLA (Contributor License Agreement).

## Good to go?

Once you've determined above topics, start a language project by leaving an issue to this repository. Make sure that we can reach you. Generally, if you're an active GitHub user, it won't be strictly necessary.

Meanwhile, you may look at [Adding a new translation](Adding_a_new_translation.md) document for further instruction. That guide might be a bit difficult to follow, but we'll help you to get it.
